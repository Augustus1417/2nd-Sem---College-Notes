**Analyzing Algorithms**

Qualities to consider:
1. *Correctness* - must produce the correct output for all valid inputs
2. *Efficiency* (Time complexity) - measures how fast the algorithm runs based on input size
3. *Space Complexity* - measures how much memory the algorithm uses
4. *Simplicity and Readability* - algorithm should be easy to understand
5. *Scalability* - determines if the algorithm can handle large inputs efficient
6. *Adaptability and Flexibility* - must be able to be modified easily to solve similar problems
7. *Stability* (for sorting) - a stable algorithm maintains the order of equal elements
8. *Optimality* - is the algorithm the best possible solution
9. *Determinism* - must produce the same output every time for same input
10. *Termination* - must eventually stop and go into an infinite loop

**Different Types of Problems** 
- *Sorting* - rearrange items
- *Searching* - find given value in a set
- *String processing* - deals with non-numeric that intensifies interest of researchers
- *Graph* - deals with objects and their connections
- *Combinatorial* - permutations
- *Geeometrical* - points, lines, polygons for computer graphics 
- *Numerical* - mathematical problems
