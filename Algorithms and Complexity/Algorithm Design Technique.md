##### Divide-and-Conquer
- Solves a problem's instance by dividing into several smaller instances, solving each of them recursively

**Importance of Divide and Conquer Algorithm Design**:
- *Solving difficult problems*
- *Algorithm efficiency*
- *Parallelism*
- *Memory Access*

**Merge Sort**
Steps:
1. *Divide array*
2. *Sort each sub-array*
3. *merge sub-arrays*

**Binary Tree Traversal**
- *Pre-order Traversal* = ==Root -> Left -> Right==
- *In-order Traversal* = ==Left -> Root -> Right==
- *Post-order Traversal* = ==Left -> Right -> Root==
